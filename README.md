## Introduction

This Project studies the international immigration to Canada from across the world for a period from 1980 - 2013.

The aim of this project is to understand the data, unearth some trends and insights regarding the pattern of immigration to Canada.

The Primary tool being Data Visualization, Matplotlib library is extensively used throughout.

## Dataset

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international immigrants as compiled by UN for the period 1980 - 2013.<br> 
The dataset spans across years from 1980 to 2013.<br>
It has various information regarding the Origin country of immigrants, continent, region, and  whether that region is classifies as  developed or developing.<br>
The data contains information from 195 countries.<br>
The Dataset has 195 rows & 43 columns<br>

## Analysis Approach

- Data Exploration followed by Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing was done.
- Further Basic statistics and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to have a better understanding of data was performed.
- Then, specific questions were explored to have more insights and understanding of trends.
- Data Visualization has been utilized prominently to derive inferences.
- The Analysis is based on:
    - Python version – 3.11.7
    - Numpy version – 1.26.2
    - Pandas version – 2.1.4
    - Matplotlib version – 3.8.0
